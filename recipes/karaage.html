    <img src="./images/j-fried-chicken.webp" alt="Karaage Chicken image">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Very easy to make and my guests enjoy it a lot! It can be served as an appetizer, or over a bed of rice as a quick weekday dinner! I usually marinate the night before to give it more flavor, but if it's a last-minute meal you are preparing, no worries, because there's still dipping sauce! Serve hot with shredded lettuce and a lemon wedge.</p>
