    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe that I developed quickly became a favorite in the test kitchen. One coworker has me make it for him for his birthday every year.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups canola oil for frying</li>
        <li>3 Â¾ pounds chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup potato starch, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Set a rack on a foil-lined baking sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour oil into a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until oil reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), about 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, toss chicken, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl until evenly coated. Spread 1/2 cup potato starch in a shallow dish; dredge chicken to coat completely and evenly. Add remaining 1/2 cup potato starch as needed. Shake off excess and transfer to a plate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add chicken to the skillet carefully, working in batches; fry until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn chicken over and fry until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 175 degrees F (80 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to the rack on the prepared baking sheet. Reheat oil between batches to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Return chicken to the skillet in batches and fry again, about 2 minutes per side.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stir gochujang, oyster sauce, mirin, ketchup, fish sauce, and garlic together in a large bowl. Add cooked chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle with white and black sesame seeds.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
